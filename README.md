# MyOS

The "MyOS for Medical System" project serves as a fundamental example of a healthcare information system operating within the resource-constrained kernel environment of Cosmos OS. This project provides an introductory exploration of essential healthcare management functionalities, highlighting the feasibility of electronic health record (EHR) systems within the Cosmos OS ecosystem. At its core, the system facilitates the creation and management of patient records, encompassing crucial patient data, such as names, ages, and diagnoses.

Additionally, it demonstrates the capacity to add and oversee medication records for patients, mimicking the medication management aspects of real-world EHR systems. Furthermore,users can schedule appointments for patients, illustrating basic appointment management capabilities in a healthcare setting.

The "MyOS for Medical Management" project was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio as the integrated development environment (IDE) and the C# programming language. Visual Studio provided a powerful and intuitive platform for creating, debugging, and testing the project. With its extensive set of tools and features, including code editors, debugging capabilities, and integrated version control, Visual Studio facilitated the development process, making it efficient and accessible.

The C# language, known for its versatility and object-oriented capabilities, was instrumental in building the core functionality of the medical management system. The combination of Visual Studio and C# allowed for the creation of a user-friendly, text-based interface for managing patient records, medications, appointments, and basic search and filtering functionalities within the Cosmos OS kernel environment. This collaborative effort showcased the potential of these
technologies in designing and implementing healthcare information systems.
